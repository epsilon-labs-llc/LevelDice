## Game Rules
1. Players have **HP**, which they use to protect themselves from attacks by increasing their **MP**.
2. The damage of attacks increases with each level. The game starts at level 1 and is completed when level 8 is reached. 
3. The game is over if the player's **HP** drops to 0 before level 8 is completed. 

### How to protect yourself
Players can increase their **MP** by consuming **HP**. 
Manage your **MP** well and defend yourself from attacks as you progress.

### MP Increase/Decrease
**MP** increases or decreases depending on the combination of the three dice rolls. 
Depending on the combination of the dice rolls, **MP** can range from 0 to 5 times. 
The figure below shows the multiplier for each combination.
